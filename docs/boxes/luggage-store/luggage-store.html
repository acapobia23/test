    <br><h3><strong>Bounce - Great for full-day storage with insurance included</strong></h3><br>
    
    <h5><a href="https://bounce.com?ref=WHEREDOLOCALS5250264">Book Bounce here</a></h5><br>
    <p><strong>Flat daily rate (up to 24h) :</strong><br><br>
      €3.50 - €5.00 - €6.90 per bag (depends on location and bag type)<br>
      No extra charge for weight — but price may vary based on luggage size:<br><br>
      <ul>
      <li>Small (handbags, totes, etc.)</li>
      <li>Standard (carry-ons, backpacks)</li>
      <li>Oversized (bikes, golf bags, large suitcases)</li>
      </ul></p>
<br>
      <p><strong>Insurance:</strong><br>
      Included automatically → up to €10,000 per bag for theft, loss or damage.</p><br>

      <p><strong>How the insurance works:</strong><br>
      You must book online to be covered<br><br>
      In case of a claim, Bounce may ask for photos, receipts, or proof of contents<br>
      For full terms, always check Bounce’s official website.</p><br>

      <p><strong>Locations and hours:</strong><br><br>
      Bounce uses partner shops, cafés, hotels and more.<br><br>
      Each location has different hours, so double-check before booking.</p><br>

      <p><strong>Booking:</strong><br><br>
      Online only (credit card, PayPal, Apple Pay)<br>
      Required for insurance</p><br>

      <p><strong>Cancellation / Refunds:</strong><br><br>
      Cancel for free anytime before your booking starts<br>
      Refunds are issued as Bounce credit for future use</p><br>

      <p><strong>Why it's awesome:</strong><br><br>
      Transparent pricing<br>
      No limits on size or weight<br>
      Market-leading insurance<br>

      <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong><br><br>

      Choose places with 4.5★ or higher and recent, positive comments.</p><br>
